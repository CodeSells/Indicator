Indicator
===========

Indicator is a simple library to indicate a step or position of a single element among a fixed vertical array of same height elements.

It is a visual element to indicate the current progress of an activity. It is also a good solution as a password strength or loading indicator.

See the [project page] [Indicator Site] for documentation and demonstration.
